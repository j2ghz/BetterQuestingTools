Unfortunately, this region is so extreme that it is essentially spatially disconnected from the rest of the Forge, unable to utilize existing upgrades to the structure and its other modules.\n\n[note]The fourth and final module of the Godforge, Heliofusion Exoticizer allows for the production of Quark Gluon Plasma and Magmatter. Initially only Quark Gluon Plasma is possible, with Magmatter requiring a much later upgrade. Consult the Godforge Information section of the UI to read how to produce these materials.[/note]\n\n[note]Usage of this module requires the QGPIU upgrade.[/note]",
