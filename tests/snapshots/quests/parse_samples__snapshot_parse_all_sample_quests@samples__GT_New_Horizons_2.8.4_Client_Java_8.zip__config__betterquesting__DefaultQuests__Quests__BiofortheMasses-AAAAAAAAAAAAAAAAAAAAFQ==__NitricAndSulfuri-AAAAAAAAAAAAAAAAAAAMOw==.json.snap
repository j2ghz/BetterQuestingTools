Overall, the easiest option for Sulfuric Acid is oil processing, but you can also make it from Sulfur Dust, which is so very common from ore processing.\n\nNitric Acid is a bit more convoluted, but you might have already automated it, since it's needed for Cetane-Boosted Diesel. Ammonia and Oxygen can make it, or Nitrogen Dioxide instead of Ammonia. You won't be able to do it in a single step, but a small line of Chemical Reactor, or their multiblock equivalent, will do it for you.",
