    "desc": "We can process Crystal Processing Units in a Laser Engraver to get the Crystal SoC. But as our demand for circuits gradually increases, this method of production is becoming untenable. We need a more advanced way to mass produce Crystal SoCs!\n\nFor that we use a new material, Cerium-doped Lutetium Aluminium Garnet (Ce:LuAG). LuAG has better performance when making Crystal SoCs - in fact it is a laser crystal material.\n\nFirst, mix Lutetium, Aluminium, Oxygen, and a little Cerium to get the material blend. Then put the blend with Molten Lutetium into an Autoclave to get a regular LuAG gem. If you have already got Oganesson you can also directly use that. As the second step, use the LuAG gem and more of the blend to produce Exquisite LuAG Gems.\n\nAfter you get the first gem, you can also use your Autoclave to grow crystals. Using the Vacuum Furnace might be a better choice to produce Exquisite LuAG Gems.\n\nLutetium, Lutetium, it needs a lot of Lutetium. How will you get a lot of Lutetium?
