This fancy table from Tinker's Construct has slots to hold the items in your recipe.\n\nYou can also use it to upgrade tools with 8 modifiers at a time. Very handy for Redstone additional speed and Lapis looting!\n\nWhen it's placed next to a vanilla chest, it will even show the chest's inventory in the crafting window. Single or double vanilla chests only, please.\n\nCut it again for a sleek, low profile version.",
