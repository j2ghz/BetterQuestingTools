Unlike phials, which must hold 8 Essentia exactly to keep it stable, Warded Jars can store anywhere from 1 to 64 Essentia.\n\nThese Warded Jars are safe to pick up and carry around, which you suspect will not be the case for most objects storing much more Essentia than these jars do. Right-click them with a label to filter that jar to a specific type of Essentia. Use a preset label if the jar is still empty.\n\nSneak-right-click with an empty hand to remove a label from a jar, or void the Essentia it contains if it doesn't have a label. Voiding Essentia from jars will not generate Flux, because... magic, I guess. It's very convenient, so just politely don't question it too much.",
