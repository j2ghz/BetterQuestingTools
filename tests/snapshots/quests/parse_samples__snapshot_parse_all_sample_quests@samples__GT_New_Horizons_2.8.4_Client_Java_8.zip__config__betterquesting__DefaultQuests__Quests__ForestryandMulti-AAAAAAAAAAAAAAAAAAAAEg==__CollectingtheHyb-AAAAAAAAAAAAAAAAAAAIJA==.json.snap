Using a grafter you can break the leaf blocks to retrieve a sapling 100%, useful for getting the forestry saplings. This doesn't seem to work with magical trees though. You can trade with villagers to get proven grafters that have a longer lifetime. Also investigate magic, you have heard rumors of long lasting grafters available to magicians.\n\nGregTech also offers a really nice tool, the Branch Cutter.",
