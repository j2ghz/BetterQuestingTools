With this modpack you can only make farmland within range of water. Let's trade some sticks for a carrot, so you can start your own farm.\n\nTo get other wheat, use a hoe on grass away from water. You'll get Witchery seeds too - save those for later.\n\nStart planting a Cotton field because it's a key early-game resource.\n\nYou can also get seeds from villages, and grow the seeds from the Pam's garden food.",
