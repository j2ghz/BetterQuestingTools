These portable tanks from EnderIO are able to push and pull liquids by themselves, as they have a built-in pump which is powered by some magic energy source. How convenient.\n\nThe pressurized versions are twice as large.\n\n[note]Just be careful, because it will eat water cells instead of returning them.[/note]",
