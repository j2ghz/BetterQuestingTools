It is arguably the easiest and most efficient way to generate lots of power for automation at this stage, and it'll last you a couple more tiers if you upgrade it as you go.\n\nAdditionally, Diesel can be used as fuel for the Copterpack, a good jetpack that makes it much easier to move around, inside and outside of your base. It's heavily recommended that you make one, if you have Diesel.\n\n[note]This will also unlock new quests in the Armors and Jetpacks tab.[/note]",
