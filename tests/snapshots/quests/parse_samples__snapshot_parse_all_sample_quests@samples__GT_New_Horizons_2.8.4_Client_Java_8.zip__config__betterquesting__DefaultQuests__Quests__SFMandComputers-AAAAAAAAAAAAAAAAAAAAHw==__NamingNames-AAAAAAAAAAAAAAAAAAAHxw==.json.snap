Closing the GUI will set the Labeler to whatever was in the text box at that time.\n\nLeft-click to set labels, right-click to open the gui. Setting a blank label will remove any existing labels.\n\n[note]May or may not be buggy. Will lose the label in MP when relogging, but works fine in SP. It'll still work until you need to change it though. Have fun![/note]",
