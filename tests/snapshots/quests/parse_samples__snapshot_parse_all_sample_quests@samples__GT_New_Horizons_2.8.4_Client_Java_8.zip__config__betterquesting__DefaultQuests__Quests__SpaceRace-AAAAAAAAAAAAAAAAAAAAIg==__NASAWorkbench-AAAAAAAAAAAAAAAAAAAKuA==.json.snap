Null catalyst can be duplicated by adding magma cream, blaze powder and a tiny pile of nether star dust.[/note]\n\n[note]Also, if you're having trouble getting the wither skulls, you can make a Cleaver or the Skullfire Sword to help with that.[/note]\n\n[warn]For ALL Rocket Quests: If you forget to complete a part quest before crafting the rocket, you can simply hold the completed rocket and those quests will autocomplete, no need to make duplicate parts.[/warn]",
