The Hydrogen Sulfide that you obtained, mixed with Water in another Chemical Reactor will give back Diluted Sulfuric Acid, which can be turned into its more concentrated form by distilling it.\n\nSulfuric Acid is one of the most important chemicals in the pack, so make sure to use this opportunity to automate it.
