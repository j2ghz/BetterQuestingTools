Deuterium is renewable from water, and you can get Helium-3 from Endstone.\n\nHowever, you will need a way to convert the plasma into EU. To do this you will need a large plasma turbine. This will also need a dynamo hatch that can handle the power you're outputting. For Helium plasma, you will want a LuV Buffered Dynamo or above.",
