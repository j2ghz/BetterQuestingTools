    "desc": "Laser hatches are a high-end way of sending lots of amps of power, so much in fact, that it starts at 256A. This goes 1024/4096/16384+ and continues from there. They're also so powerful that only a few machines support them outside of the ever §owonderful§r TecTech: LSC, MBF, MVF, and PSS. Remember to paint the Laser Vacuum Pipes, the Source Hatch, and the Target Hatch. Also, Source = Output, Target = Input. Laser Vacuum Pipes do not split or bend, to turn your laser use [note]Active Transformer[/note]. Later on you can use Laser Vacuum Mirror to bend your Laser Vacuum Pipes, this will however not allow splitting.\n\n[note]Laser hatches can have their operational amperage adjusted in their GUI.[/note]\n\n[warn]Be careful with using very high amp hatches as every Laser Hatch has 1EU/s * max amps passive power loss. For example, a 256A Laser Source Hatch and 256A Laser Target Hatch will both lose 256 EU/s regardless of the amount of power flowing through.[/warn]",
