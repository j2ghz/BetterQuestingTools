To configure an item/liquid, type in the item's name [e.g. if you want to export all ores put \"ore*\"]. The rate of export is very fast.\n\n[note]PS: Use crushed* & !crushedPurified* & !crushedCentrifuged* to get any crushed ore, but not ore that has been washed, then crushed (to get purified) or run through the thermal centrifuge.[/note]\n\nThe card can be used in more devices, and causes less lag, but works in a similar way. Put it inside a bus and set the filter using the T looking button that appears. The standalone bus is no longer craftable.",
