The recipe is pretty expensive, but once you made the next tier of reactor, you will unlock a simpler and cheaper one. However, to get there you will need a lot of americium already, so better make sure you are producing enough lutetium.\n\nLet's start with just 48 ingots. Enough for a single UV motor.",
