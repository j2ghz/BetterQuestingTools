Remember that you were the one that chose to be here.\n\n[note]A number of endgame recipes have now opened up. Check the Endgame Goals tab or NEI recipes for the Table to see what they are.[/note]\n\n[note]Something else to note is that there's an automated DCT if you happen to need a lot of these (hint: you will).[/note]",
