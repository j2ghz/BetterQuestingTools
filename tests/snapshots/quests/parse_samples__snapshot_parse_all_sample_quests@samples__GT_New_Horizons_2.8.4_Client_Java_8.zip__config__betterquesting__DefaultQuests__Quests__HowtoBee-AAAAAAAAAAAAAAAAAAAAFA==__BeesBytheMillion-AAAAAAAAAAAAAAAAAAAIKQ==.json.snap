    "desc": "If you need endgame high speed production, industrial apiaries are the way to go. Industrial Apiaries take upgrade frames that never break. Production frames can be stacked up to 8 high. It also has many options for emulation, more pollen retrieval, and others.\n\nThe Industrial Apiary is now a GT machine. It takes up to UV voltage and up to 4 amps but the base usage is just 37 EU/t. You can no longer use a World Accelerator and there is only the one machine, so no GT overclocking. Instead, there are new §oacceleration upgrades§r that act similar to a World Accelerator but are directly integrated into the machine. You will want to use them, they increase the speed and energy usage by a lot. The final tier also increases productivity.\n\nBut I shouldn't drone on too long. Go make one and find out yourself.",
