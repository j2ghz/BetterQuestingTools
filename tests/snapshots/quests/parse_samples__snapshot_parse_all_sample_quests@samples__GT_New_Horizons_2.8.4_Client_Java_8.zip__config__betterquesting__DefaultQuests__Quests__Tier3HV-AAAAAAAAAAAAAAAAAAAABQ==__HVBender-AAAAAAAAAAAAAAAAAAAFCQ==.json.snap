    "desc": "An HV Bender is 4x faster than your LV Bender, but it also opens up an important recipe - Tin Cans!\n\nWith this bender you can turn Tin Casings into Tin Cans. Using the Tin Cans with food in a Canner will make Canned Food. This can stack up to 64, and will fully restore your shanks - no need to rotate food types anymore! You will eat as much as you need with one click. One drawback is you will no longer get the Well Fed buff with its slight health regen bonus, nor will you gain more hearts from eating new food. Also, these cans don't fit in the lunch bag or lunch box so you don't need those anymore.",
