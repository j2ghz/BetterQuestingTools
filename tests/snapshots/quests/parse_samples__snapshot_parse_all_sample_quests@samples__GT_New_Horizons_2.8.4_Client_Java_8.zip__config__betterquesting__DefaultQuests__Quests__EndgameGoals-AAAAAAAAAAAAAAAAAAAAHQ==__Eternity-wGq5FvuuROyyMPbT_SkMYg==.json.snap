You'll also need it to make MHDCSM parts.\n\nKickstarting the loop is expensive and RNG-based. You need 20,736 L of Universium for the first 5 attempts and a catalyst.\n\nThe QFT recipe has a 25% chance of yielding Eternity per attempt. You should probably boost the QFT with plasmas and focus on producing Eternity.\n\n[note]Did you know the QFT has a fluid mode? It could be useful for extracting molten Shirabon. Just right-click the controller with a §ascrewdriver§r.[/note]\n\n[note]Building a full beacon out of Eternity Blocks might be a bit extravagant, don't you think?[/note]",
