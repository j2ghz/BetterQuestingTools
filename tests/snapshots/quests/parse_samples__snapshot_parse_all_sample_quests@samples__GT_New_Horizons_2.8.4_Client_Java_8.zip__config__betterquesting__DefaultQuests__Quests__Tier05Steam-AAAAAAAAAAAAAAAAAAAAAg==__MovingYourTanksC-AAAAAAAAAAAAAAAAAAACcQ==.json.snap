Make a dolly and you can carry your full chests, barrels or storage drawers anywhere you want. But be warned, you will get a slowness debuff so hopefully you don't have to travel very far. You can also move non-portable buildcraft and iron tanks without losing fluids, and worktables without losing stored recipes.\n\nShift-right-click an empty dolly to collapse it. It won't carry anything until you unfold it, but it will stack and can go in your backpack.\n\n§3PS: Later on you can fly or make a traveller's belt to get around the debuff.§r",
