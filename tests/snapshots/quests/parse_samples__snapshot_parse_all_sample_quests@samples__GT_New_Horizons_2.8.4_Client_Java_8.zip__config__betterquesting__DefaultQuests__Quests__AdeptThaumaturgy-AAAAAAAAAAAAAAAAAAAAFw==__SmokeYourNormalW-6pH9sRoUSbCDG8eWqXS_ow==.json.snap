This is a fairly cheap and sustainable option for removing your Normal warp (assuming you have a good option to get a lot of Vis).\n\nIt also has a chance to reduce your temporary warp.\n\n[note]The chance to reduce your normal warp per Relaxing Tobacco is 10%, so you'll be needing a bunch of it.[/note]\n",
