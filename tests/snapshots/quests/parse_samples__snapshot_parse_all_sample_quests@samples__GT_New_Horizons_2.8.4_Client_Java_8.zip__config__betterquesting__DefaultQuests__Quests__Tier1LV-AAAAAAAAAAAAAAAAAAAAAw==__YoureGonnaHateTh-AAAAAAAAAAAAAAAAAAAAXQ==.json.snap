Adjust the flow direction and redstone behavior with a screwdriver. Place it on the side facing the tank or machine. When looking at a pipe or machine, you can use the grid to place it on a side already touching another thing. You can use the grid with a screwdriver to adjust a cover on that side as well.\n\nWhen a GT pipe or machine has any cover, including a pump cover, wrenching the machine back into an item keeps the cover on that machine. The cover stays with the machine in the same direction when it is placed down again. This way you can arrange pump and conveyor covers on a machine outside a tight spot and place it there. To remove covers, use the crowbar.\n\nIt can also be further upgraded into a fluid regulator that allows precise control of fluid transfer speed.\n\nYou can access covers interface with Shift+RMB.",
