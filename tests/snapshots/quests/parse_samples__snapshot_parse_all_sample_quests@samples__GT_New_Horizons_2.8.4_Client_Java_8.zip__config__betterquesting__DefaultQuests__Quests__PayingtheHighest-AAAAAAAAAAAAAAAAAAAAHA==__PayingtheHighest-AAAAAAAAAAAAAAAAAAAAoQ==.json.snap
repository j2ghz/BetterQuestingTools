Plan for the configuration to grow in size up to 23x23 for a single altar.\n\nKeep in mind that you get less blood, and use more when crafting in GTNH. Plan for pain and frustration too.\n\nThe altar has a 10,000L blood tank, plus a 1,000L I/O buffer (you can pump in and out, but the rate is pitifully low at the start). Blood will flow to the I/O buffer until it's full, so be aware of that before your first craft.",
