It sometimes creates taint when it lands, and it very rarely creates a node if it destroys the block it impacts. Its base vis cost constantly fluctuates. [note]Maybe studying it and its projectiles will give you a better understanding of vis.[/note]\n\n[note]This focus accepts the following upgrades in the Focal Manipulator:[/note]\n§5Frugal§r: Lowers vis cost to cast by 10% per level\n§5Seeker§r (level 3): The orb homes in on the closest target, but loses some of its special effects like creating taint or nodes\n",
