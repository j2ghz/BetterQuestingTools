    "desc": "Kinetic generator compatibility has been improved so that you no longer need transformers, you can connect directly with a cable. But why not use your transformer to send the power back to base more efficiently, it's a loss of about 97EU per HV amp just going from 160 straight down to 63 without it. If you transform up (after going through 1 block of cable to transform it to GT power), you only lose about 97EU per EV amp, which saves 4x the energy in regard to cable loss.\n\n[warn]IC2 machines don't care about rain, but remember to cover your transformer.[/warn]",
