Try to craft 5 pairs of gates in the least amount of time, then come in #screenshot-brag and post your time to see where your infrastructure stands in the community!\n\n[note]This quest and “See You Next Time!” are mutually exclusive; completing one will lock the other.\n\nIf you are going for 100% questbook completion, don't panic, finishing either quest still allows the tab to receive a green check (much like the previous XOR quests).[/note]\n\n§dEnjoy your round of Minesweeper!\n",
