You discovered how to craft tools that can be repaired and upgraded, but for that you definitely need a more advanced crafting technique.\n\n[note]If you don't have access to oak wood for creating your Part Builder, you can shapelessly craft yours into the oak variant for purposes of completing this quest[/note]",
