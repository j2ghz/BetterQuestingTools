These two block tall plants, which require good light to grow, will produce Briar Seed Bags when harvested. Those can be combined with sugar and a suitable container in an Arcane Workbench to create Rosehip Syrup.\n\nRosehip Syrup stacks up to 16 and can be used the same as milk, also removing some (though not all) Warp effects as well as Flux Flue and Flux Phage.\n\nThe plant has a strange life cycle where the seed pods will first appear as yellow dots, turn pink as they start to mature, then §odisappear§r, only to return fully matured. Still, if it works, it works.",
