    "desc": "The Slimeling is a utility mob that spawns from Slimeling Eggs found on the surface of Mars. It shares some features from vanilla wolves and mules: it can be tamed and attacks mobs that threaten its owners, and can be equipped with a special chest to transport items.\n\nAs an allied mob, Slimelings will actively help and follow the player-owner and will attempt to protect them. They can also have a neutral behavior, that is, they can attack if provoked or hurt by non-owners.\n\nItems that you can feed Slimelings with:\n\nBoat\nCooked fish\nGunpowder\nGold ingot\nRedstone repeater\nWooden door\n\nSlimelings can be equipped by their owners with a Slimeling Inventory Bag to transport items.\n\nTo complete this quest get any one of the eggs - note you may need a Heavy Duty Pickaxe.",
