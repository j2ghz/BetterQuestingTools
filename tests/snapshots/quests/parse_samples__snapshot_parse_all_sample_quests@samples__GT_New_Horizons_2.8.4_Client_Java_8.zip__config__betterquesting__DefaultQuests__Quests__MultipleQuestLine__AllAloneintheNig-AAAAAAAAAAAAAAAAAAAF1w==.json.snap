This means you'll get all new quests automatically upon updating to a new version of GTNH! Isn't that convenient?\n\nIf, for whatever reason, you want to manually reload your questbook, you can do so by typing /bq_admin default load in the chat window. You will need to be an admin for it to work, though.\n\nHere's another questbook in case you already lost the one you spawned with. Don't forget that it can also be viewed at any time by pressing the Tilde (~) key if you have not changed its keybind.\n\n§3Some command blocks are still used for specific tasks, but they do not concern the average player since they are admin-only and thus are not craftable.",
