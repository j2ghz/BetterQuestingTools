Small black steel turbines should be fine for now. You'll need two amps of steady power to keep the scrubber working.\n\nThe detector's setting can be changed by clicking on the +/- texture with a screwdriver. Also, in general, better (and larger) turbines work better at cleaning up pollution. The code is too complex to fully explain here, but that's basically it. More EU turbine = more pollution cleaning turbine.\n\n[warn]This quest covers one method of combating pollution - there are others, including not making as much to begin with.[/warn]",
