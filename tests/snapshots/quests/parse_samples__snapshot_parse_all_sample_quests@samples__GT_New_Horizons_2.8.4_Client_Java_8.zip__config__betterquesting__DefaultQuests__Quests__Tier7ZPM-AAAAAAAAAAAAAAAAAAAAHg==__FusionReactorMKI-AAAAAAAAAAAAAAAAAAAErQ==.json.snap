The energy hatches must now be at least ZPM too.\n\nEach energy hatch has an energy capacity of 20M EU and draws up to 8192 EU/t. That means it can handle start costs up to 320M EU and power consumption up to 131072 EU/t. Furthermore, MK I recipes in a MK II reactor are granted a 2/2 perfect overclock which doubles the speed and power consumption.",
