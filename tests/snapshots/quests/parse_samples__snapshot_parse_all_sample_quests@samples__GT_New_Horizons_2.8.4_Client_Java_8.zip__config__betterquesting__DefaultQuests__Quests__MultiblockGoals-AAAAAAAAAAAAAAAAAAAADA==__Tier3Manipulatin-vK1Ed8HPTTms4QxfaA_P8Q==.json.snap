This tier unlocks two powerful new skips: the §6final naqline skip§r and the §6stem cell skip§r.\n\nThis new casing requires even more advanced materials still, including the §3Superconductor Rare-Earth Composite§r, which can only be crafted in a tier 2 QFT. Unlike §3Hyper-Stable Self-Healing Adhesive§r, which focused on structural integrity, this composite is designed purely for energy transmission. With automatic self-repair now fully handled, we can shift our focus to increasing the energy flow between components and into the multi itself.\n\nStandard superconductors break down under quantum stress - but this composite eliminates all resistance across the outer shell. Its precisely layered rare-earth elements create such gradual transitions that quantum flow moves effortlessly, with no losses or destabilizing effects.\n\n§oWhat will you discover next?!",
