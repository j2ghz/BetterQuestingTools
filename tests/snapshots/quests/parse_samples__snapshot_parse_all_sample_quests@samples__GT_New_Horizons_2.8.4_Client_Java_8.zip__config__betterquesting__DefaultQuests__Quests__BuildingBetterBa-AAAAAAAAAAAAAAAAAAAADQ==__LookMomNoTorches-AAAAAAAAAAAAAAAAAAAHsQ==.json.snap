These come in stone and metallic varieties. The stone varieties don't need much to craft. One plus/minus for these lanterns is that they are solid blocks - while you cannot walk through them, they also do not fall if the surrounding blocks are removed. Search \"lantern\" in NEI for more varieties. They are a bit annoying to craft now, but if you check NEI you can make them pretty easily with assemblers later.",
