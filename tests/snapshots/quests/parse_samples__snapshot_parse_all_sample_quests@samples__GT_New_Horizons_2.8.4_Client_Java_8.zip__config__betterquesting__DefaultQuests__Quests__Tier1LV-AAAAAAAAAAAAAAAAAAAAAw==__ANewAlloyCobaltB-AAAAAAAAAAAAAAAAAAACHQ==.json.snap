Mix it with tin and cobalt dust (you can get it as a byproduct of a couple ores, go searching in the nether, or go to the Twilight Forest for Cobaltite) to get the cobalt brass dust.\n\nNow that you've come this far, we think that you're able to look up the ores that you need by yourself with the help of NEI.",
