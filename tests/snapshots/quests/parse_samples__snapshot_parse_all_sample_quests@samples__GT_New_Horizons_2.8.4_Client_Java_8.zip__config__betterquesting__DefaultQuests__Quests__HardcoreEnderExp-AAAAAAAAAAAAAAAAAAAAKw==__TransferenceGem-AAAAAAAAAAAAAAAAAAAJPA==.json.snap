    "desc": "The Transference Gem is used to teleport to a marked location.\n\nThe Transference Gem uses Energy and can be charged in an Energy Extraction Table. Shift-right-clicking on a block with a Transference Gem in hand will link the gem to that block.\nThe state of the gem itself will switch to \"Linked\", as seen in its tooltip.\nAfter linking, the player can right-click with a Transference Gem in hand to teleport to the linked block, using some of the Energy stored in the gem.\n\nUsing F3+H to enable detailed item tooltips makes the Transference Gem show the exact coordinates and the dimension of the linked location.\n\nOnce the charge of the Transference Gem becomes lower than 44%, negative effects will appear:\n\nDeflection - the player will be teleported to a random location instead of the linked block.\nVarious negative potion effects, the lower the charge is - the longer they will last:\n\nSlowness II\nNausea I\nWeakness II\nHunger I\n\nEndermen - Angry Endermen will spawn and attack the player.\nItem drop - a random amount of items in player's inventory will drop to the ground.\nStorm - will cause a 2-3 minute storm. This is the rarest effect.",
