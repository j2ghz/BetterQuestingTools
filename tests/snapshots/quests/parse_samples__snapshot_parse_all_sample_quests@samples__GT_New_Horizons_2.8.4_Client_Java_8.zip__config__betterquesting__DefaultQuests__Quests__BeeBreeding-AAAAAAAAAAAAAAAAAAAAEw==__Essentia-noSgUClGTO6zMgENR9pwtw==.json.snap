To do so, however, it requires an Apimancer's Drainer beneath its housing.\n\nThe speed at which the bee produces essentia is affected by its production speed. You have to right-click the drainer with a filled phial of the desired essentia to lock it to that type.\n\nYou can breed them from chaotic and ordered bees.\n\n§3You can also place up to 9 drainers beneath a single alveary as long as the blocks at the bottom are plain alveary blocks.",
