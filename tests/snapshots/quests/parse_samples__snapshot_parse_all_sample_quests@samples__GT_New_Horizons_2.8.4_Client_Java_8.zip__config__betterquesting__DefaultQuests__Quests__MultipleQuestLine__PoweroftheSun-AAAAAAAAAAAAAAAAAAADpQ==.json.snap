Most GT machines can use them as covers, and receive power, but only so long as it can see the sun (the top). Be sure to put a glass layer above them in case it rains while you swap panels. You'll still want to keep rain off the sides of the machine hull too.\n\n[note]The Aluminium Iron plate needs an MV Forming Press.[/note]",
