Now it's time to make a quiver and maybe some arrows.\n\nTo place arrows in the quiver, put the quiver and the stack of arrows in a crafting grid. Make sure the Gameplay key Special doesn't conflict with other keybinds. By default, it is Z. When you have the bow selected, use Z to swap arrow slots in the quiver.\n\nWhile it seems like these might be worthless, these arrows do have special uses. You really want to share a cookie with friends, don't you?\n\nLet's go hunt a bit.",
