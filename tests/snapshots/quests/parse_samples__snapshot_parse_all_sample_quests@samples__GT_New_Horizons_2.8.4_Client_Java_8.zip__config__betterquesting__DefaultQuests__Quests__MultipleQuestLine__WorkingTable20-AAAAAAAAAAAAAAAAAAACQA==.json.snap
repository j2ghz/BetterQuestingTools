Right-click to lock a memorized recipe and prevent a newer recipe from bumping it off.\n\nResources need to go into the internal inventory. The crafting matrix is only a visual representation.\n\nThe Forestry worktable is super-useful, and can reduce the tedium of many common jobs because you can click-drag across a row of items, and it will use tools in its own inventory to continue crafting.\n\nSpecifically:\nMaking <Item X> with <Bucket of Y> - Put all the ingredients into the table, and if the recipe is selected, shift-click the result to craft them all at once (until you run out)\nMaking fresh water for Pam's - Same as above, but no second item\nMaking clay bricks - The wooden form is automatically reused\nMaking anything that uses a tool - Also automatically reused, while consuming durability\n\n[warn]Warning: Stored recipes will be lost if the worktable is broken! To avoid this, move it using a dolly.[/warn]\n\n[note]For more forestry quests you need to go to the dedicated tab.[/note]",
