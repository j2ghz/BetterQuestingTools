    "desc": "Once you have the two plasmas from before, fuse them together into a new one, Neon Plasma. If you were to use this directly, you could get Neon! There are other, more useful materials to get later in this process, so keep a lookout for those.\n\nHowever, this is not the final plasma in mk1 recipes. To get it, you need to do the last activation step, which exists in all three chains, and involves adding a non-plasma related material, of the appropriate GT tier, to obtain the powergen plasma. The material you need here is Arcanite, one you probably have used before. This step requires you to preferably automate it with ABS, and have a steady supply of Thorium 232.\n\nIf you look at the last recipe, you'll see it's 144L Neon Plasma input to 1000L Force Plasma output. This multiplying makes it so that step, and all final steps, are the slowest ones. You will need 0.144 Neon Plasma reactors for every Force Plasma reactor, which means that 1 Neon reactor feeds nearly 7 Force reactors (6.9444... reactors, more precisely).\n\nOnce you get Force Plasma, this is the end of the mk1 fusion chain. Force Plasma is a 150M fuel value plasma, which means it has a 53.5% penalty with Infinity Catalyst in XL Plasma Generators. This is better than Helium Plasma with its 86.1% penalty but still not great for power generation. You probably don't need this in ZPM, but it'll be a stepping stone for your future progression.",
