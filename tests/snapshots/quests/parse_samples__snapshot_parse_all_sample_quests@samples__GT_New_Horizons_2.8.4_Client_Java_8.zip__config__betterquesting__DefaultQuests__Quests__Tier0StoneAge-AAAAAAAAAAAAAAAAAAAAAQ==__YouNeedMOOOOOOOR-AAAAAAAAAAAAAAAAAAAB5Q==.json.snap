Try to find some spruce saplings and some jungle saplings. Both can be planted in a 2x2 grid to get bigger trees.\n\nThe Rainforest Oak is also a great source of wood, and only needs one sapling. Be warned though, this tree is §lmuch taller§r than the Jungle or Spruce trees\n\n[warn]Warning label: Do not put your pets in the microwave to dry them. And do not plant any of these rewards in the middle of your base.[/warn]",
