    "desc": "The Wand Focus: Pech's Curse is a rare wand focus which cannot be crafted by players. It can only be obtained from a Pech Mage -- either by bartering valuable items or by killing it for its wand to drop. Pech Mages are rare and the drop chance is quite low, so bartering is recommended. [warn]If attacked, the Pech will use this focus against you![/warn]\n\nThis focus fires a small ball of energy with a bright bluish-green trail. This missile is affected by gravity, so the shots need to be \"arced\" to hit distant targets. When the shot hits a mob, it does one heart of damage and randomly inflicts one of several effects on the target: Poison, Weakness, or Slowness.\n\n[note]This focus accepts the following upgrades in the Focal Manipulator:[/note]\n§5Frugal§r: Lowers vis cost to cast by 10% per level\n§5Potency§r: Increases potency of the applied effect. Being able to apply Weakness III to mobs might be useful for Blood Magic...\n§5Extend§r (even levels): Extends the duration of the applied effect\n§5Nightshade§r (level 5): Applies all three effects at once",
