Each crafting CPU multiblock allows for a separate crafting job (this is different from sub-tasks of the same job). The more items in the recipe and sub-recipes, the more crafting storage you'll need. Having one big and a couple small might be a good idea, but remember it will try to use the best one available first when you order a craft. They are also used when a crafting card requests a craft, so you'll need several separate ones if you intend to use those a lot. A crafting CPU multiblock uses only one channel, regardless of its size. It must be square to form.",
