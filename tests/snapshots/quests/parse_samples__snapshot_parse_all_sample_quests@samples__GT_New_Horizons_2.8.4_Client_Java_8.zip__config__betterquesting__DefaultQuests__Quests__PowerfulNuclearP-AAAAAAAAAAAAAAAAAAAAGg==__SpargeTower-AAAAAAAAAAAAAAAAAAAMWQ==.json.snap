The best LFTR fuel, Fuel 3, is locked after this, and a lot of useful byproducts are only obtainable here as well, so it's important that you build this if you have a working LFTR.\n\nThe structure itself is very similar to a Distillation Tower, but with different blocks. The controller is the most expensive part, but the biggest obstacle is having the Assembly Line; everything after that shouldn't be too difficult. It's recommended that you have more than one tower, but for one focus on making only one.\n\nNote: the height of this tower is not adjustable. It is meant to be a 3x8x3 multiblock with at least 45 Sparge Tower Casings.",
