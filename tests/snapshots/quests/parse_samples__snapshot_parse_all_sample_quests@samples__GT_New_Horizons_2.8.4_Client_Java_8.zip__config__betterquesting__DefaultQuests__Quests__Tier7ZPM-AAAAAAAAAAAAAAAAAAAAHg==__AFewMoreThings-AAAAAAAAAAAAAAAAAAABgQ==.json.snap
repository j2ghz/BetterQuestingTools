I need to update some of my machines, as these exotic components you got me damaged some of them already. Don't worry, I have a list here.\n\nSome of my circuits burned to a crisp while I was trying to measure the conductivity of these soul and life shards. I need better ones.\n\nGood lord, these mysterious crystals have eaten away my diamond grinding head! How could that happen? Can you get me a better one?\n\nDo you see that pile of Rhodium and Palladium over there? No? Neither do I. Because the machine was VAPORIZED! Good that you gave me 2 singularities, the first one... Well... Just get me a better casing, would you?\n\nIt seems, that the stabilizers need... stabilizing... But I'm out of field generators. Can you help me with this?",
