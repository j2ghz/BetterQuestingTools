So a new more advanced nanite will be needed to produce complex nanites.\n\nThe neutronium nanite is an in-between of the two tiers able to produce tier 2 nanites, which have other uses.\n\n[note]When putting the neutronium nanite in the controller, you will need to wait for the structure check to happen again or break and replace the controller with a neutronium nanite inside. Allows the Nano Forge to make tier 2 nanites.[/note]",
