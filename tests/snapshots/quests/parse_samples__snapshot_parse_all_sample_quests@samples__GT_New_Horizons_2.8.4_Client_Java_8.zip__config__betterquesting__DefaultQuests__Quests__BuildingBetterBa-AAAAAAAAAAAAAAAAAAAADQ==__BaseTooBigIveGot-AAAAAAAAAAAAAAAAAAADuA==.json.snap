Next output it into a Fluid Solidifier with a block mold to make concrete blocks.\n\nYou'll move faster on top of these blocks. They can even be turned into bricks to prevent unwanted spawns! Hint: 10 buckets of wet mix converts to exactly 160 blocks. These blocks can also be Chiseled into different varieties.",
