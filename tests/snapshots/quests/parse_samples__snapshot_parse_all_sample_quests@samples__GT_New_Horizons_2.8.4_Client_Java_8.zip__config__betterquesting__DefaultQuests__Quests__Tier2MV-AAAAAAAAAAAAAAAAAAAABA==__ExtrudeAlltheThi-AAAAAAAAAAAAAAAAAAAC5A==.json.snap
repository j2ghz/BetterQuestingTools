Most extruder recipes use more than 32 EU/t so you need an MV extruder. After crafting the machine you need extruder shapes for the different types of parts you will want to make.\n\nThere are a few more shapes than the ones listed here. Make sure to have a look.\n\n[note]Most of the Tinkers Gregworks tool parts are made in the extruder. They also have long extrusion times to balance out their usefulness.[/note]",
