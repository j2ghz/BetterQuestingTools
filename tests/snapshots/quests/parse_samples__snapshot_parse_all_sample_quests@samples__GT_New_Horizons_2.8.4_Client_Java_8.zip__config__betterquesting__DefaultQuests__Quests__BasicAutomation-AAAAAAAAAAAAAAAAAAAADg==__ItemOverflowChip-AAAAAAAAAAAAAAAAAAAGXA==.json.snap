It is strongly recommended to have a default storage for items in every pipe system, otherwise bad stuff can happen. Best used with a large chest (diamond for example).\n\nIt seems to have some bugs though, so don't craft more than one without testing it first.\n\nYou might have to just use a normal item responder and add the items you want routed back to your overflow spot.",
