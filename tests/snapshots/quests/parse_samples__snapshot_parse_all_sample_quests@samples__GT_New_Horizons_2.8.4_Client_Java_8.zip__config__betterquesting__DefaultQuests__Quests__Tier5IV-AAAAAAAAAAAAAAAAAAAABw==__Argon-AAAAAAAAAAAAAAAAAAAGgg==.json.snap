Unlike centrifuging Compressed Air Cells, you'll need to turn the Air into Liquid Air first in a Vacuum Freezer so you can centrifuge it more efficiently.\n\nYou can also make the Air Intake Hatch - it's much better than spamming compressors!\n\nDon't bother with the DT recipe unless you need the other fluids from it, it's not nearly as good as centrifuging. You also need the Liquid Air Fluid Hatch (only works with Liquid Air!) and Giant Output Hatch when you want to do that.",
