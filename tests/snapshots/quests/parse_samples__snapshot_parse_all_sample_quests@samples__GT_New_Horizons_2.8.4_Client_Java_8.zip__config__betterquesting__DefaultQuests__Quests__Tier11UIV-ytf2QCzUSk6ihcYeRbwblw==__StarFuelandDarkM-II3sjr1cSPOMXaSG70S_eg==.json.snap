Stabilizing this fuel with Exotic Catalyst, and drastically increasing the density of the fuel with other things leads you to something that may just work.\n\nDuring this synthesis, you realize that this fuel could be used to make [note]Dark Matter[/note], something you previously had only seen on the Mehen Belt in the Amun-Ra System.\n\n[note]Dark Matter Shards can be found in the Mehen Belt and mined manually, if you don't want to synthesize it.[/note]",
