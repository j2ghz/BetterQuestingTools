The easiest might be just a tank or pipe. This will help until you have access to a Large Heat Exchanger or a Vacuum Freezer.\n\nAn advanced or overclocked reactor vent is much faster than a basic heat vent and can work without a water block in front of it, albeit slower. Unfortunately, you can't make those yet, but you can keep that in mind for later.",
