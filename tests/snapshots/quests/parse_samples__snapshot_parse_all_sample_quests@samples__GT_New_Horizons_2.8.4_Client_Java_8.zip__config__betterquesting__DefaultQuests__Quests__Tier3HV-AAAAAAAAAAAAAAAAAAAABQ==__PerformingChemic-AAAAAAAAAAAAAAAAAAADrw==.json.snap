In addition to having a more efficient overclock, the LCR can input multiple liquids so you won't need to mess with those pesky cells any longer. \n\n[note]If you choose to go the LCR route, be sure to take a look at the PTFE questline just ahead of this one, starting with \"Teflon Don\".[/note]\n",
