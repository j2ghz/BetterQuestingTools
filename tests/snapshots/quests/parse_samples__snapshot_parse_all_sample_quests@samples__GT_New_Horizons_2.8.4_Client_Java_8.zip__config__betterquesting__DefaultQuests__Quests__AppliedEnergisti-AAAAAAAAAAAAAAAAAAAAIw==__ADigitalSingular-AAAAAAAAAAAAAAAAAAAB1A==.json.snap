Anyway, you'd better make something EVEN bigger then.\n\nHmm, adding even more storage capacity to a single cell would result in something so dense with information that it would just collapse into a singularity. So why not be smart about it? Just use an already existing singularity! Build a sturdy casing around it and add some connecting components, and you should be good. Better use an eternal singularity, though, to make sure things remain stable.\n\n[note]The Digital Singularity can store more than 4 quintillion items. If you manage to fill one up, please contact the dev team so that they can ban you for cheating... eh, I mean, congratulate you on your achievement, of course![/note]",
