Polyethylene, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Rubber, Charcoal, etc. Faster item pipes will help with transporting items quicker around your base. For now, use your spiffy new extruder to craft some brass item pipes.\n\nThe reward - restrictive item pipes - allow you to prioritize destinations. Locations on the other side of a restrictive pipe are treated as much further away than locations on the same side of a pipe. Very handy when you want overflow (or non-matching) items to go somewhere else!\n\nFor higher tiers, look up \"item pipe\" in NEI, or just look at the spreadsheet.",
