By using steam to create a spinning force, this Multiblock can separate different materials quickly and easily.\n\nIf you think separation is taking forever, the Steam Separator will speed things up!\n\n§3This Multiblock can process recipes up to LV Tier, and does accept an Output Hatch for recipes. But if you are looking to use recipes which require Fluid Inputs, you might have to build an LV Centrifuge in the future.",
