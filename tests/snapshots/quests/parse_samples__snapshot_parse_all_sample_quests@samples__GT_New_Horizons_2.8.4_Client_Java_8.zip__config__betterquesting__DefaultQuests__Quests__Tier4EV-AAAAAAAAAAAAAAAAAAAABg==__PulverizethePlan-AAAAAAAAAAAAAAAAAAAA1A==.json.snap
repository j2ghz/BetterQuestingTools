Does consume quite a bit of power, but can really help you out.\n\nFor Tungstate, you can centrifuge previously macerated moon dust, macerate end stone with an HV+ macerator and then centrifuge it, or centrifuge endergoo (found all over the end, does not give back buckets).\n\nIf you want to make your rocket, you need to get at least a little before you can get to a planet with the ore. However, keep in mind that you'll need an EBF with TPV Coils to smelt Tungstensteel Dust into the ingot!\n\n[note]Do one of the tasks.[/note]",
