You'll need to constantly provide it with coolant for it to run, otherwise you'll have maintenance issues every time it runs dry.\n\nOutput energy can be increased by increasing EU/t (scales with the cbrt) or increasing length (scales linearly). The latter also decreases focus, however.\n\nFocus in turn can be improved by using a better/lower temperature coolant (options listed on tooltip).\n\nNote that Amount remains unchanged.",
