(It's recommended to do this ritual in a space dimension, as the demon city spreads up to 1000x1000 blocks)\n\n[note]You should also be starting the ritual from the ground rather than in the air for the best results![/note]\n\nRequirements:\n- 15M LP (Archmage Blood Orb and >= 13 Runes of the Orb)\n- 8 Crystal Belljars (one filled with each of: magicales, potentia, incendium, terrae, tenebrae, sanctus, aether, and aquasalus)\n- 1 Sacrifice (Bottle a lesser demon/elemental in a soul vial)\n- 1 Master Ritual Stone, 128 Ritual Stones, and 1 Blood Altar\n- 1 Awakened Activation Crystal\n\nSteps to the Ritual:\n1.

Too many people did not follow the recommendation and servers suffered for it. It also does not work well in the Personal Dimension.[/warn]",
