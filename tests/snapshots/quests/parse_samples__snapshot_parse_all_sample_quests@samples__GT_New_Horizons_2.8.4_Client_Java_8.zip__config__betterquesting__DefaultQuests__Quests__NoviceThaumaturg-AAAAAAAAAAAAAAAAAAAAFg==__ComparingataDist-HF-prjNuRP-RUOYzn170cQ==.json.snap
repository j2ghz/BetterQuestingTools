If you could do so remotely that would free you from one major constraint.\n\nRemote Comparators allow you to do just that. Sneak-right-click with a crystalline eye to bind the block you want to watch, and place the eye in a remote comparator to start monitoring the block remotely.\n\nGiven the extra distance, though the range of the remote comparator is quite limited, you should expect the §otiniest§r amount of signal lag compared to a direct comparator. You're doubtful that is ever going to be a limiting factor, though.",
