Well if so; better brace yourself for the Netherite line!\n\nDon't panic, it's a relatively straight-forward line so long as you can wrap your head around minor processing loops and percent based output. Fortunately you have a quest book to guide you through your initial setup.\n\nBe warned- you will need at least §2§lGrade 1 Purified Water§r and§5§l Naquadah Coils§r to make it through this entire line.\n\n§3This questline will start you off with the three primary things you must prepare in order to begin:\n\n§l- Milled Netherrack\n- Nether Air\n- Ancient Debris Collection§r\n\n§3For at least one and likely two of those you will need to journey into the nether, so make sure you're prepared equipment wise!§r\n\n[warn]If you already created the line and do not wish to complete the individual quests, hold one of these three item sets in your hand after completing this quest: [/warn]\n\n§4§l- 1 Dense Netherite Plate\n- 64 Intensely Bonded Netherite Nanoparticles\n- 16 Netherite Ingots ",
