But that's up to you.\n\nAs a special reward, you get a pair of Holo Glasses to look inside your inventories. Place it into the mask slot, and use the keybind to turn it on.\n\n[note]Tip: If you double-click the NEI search field the resulting highlighted search also applies to what you can see with your Holo Glasses![/note]",
