Moving on, to make it, combine Phthalic Anhydride and Ethylbenzene in the Chemical Plant to make 2-Ethylanthraquinone.\n\nBTW the other recipe that makes this is used later in the processing chain. You can loop the 2-Ethylanthraquinone so you don't have to make more if you don't want to scale up.\n\n[note]You need Palladium for the next quest.[/note]",
