Your experiments lead you to using the newly discovered Mellion with a Transcendent Metal Nanite to create what seems like a crystal seed of some type, which exhibits perfect thermal conductance.\n\nProcessing this seed further into a solution, you realize you can grow this crystal into a slurry-like solution, which you decide to name [note]Phonon Transfer Medium[/note]. This incredible material displays exactly the properties you were looking for, and decide that now you can move forward with the second module of the Godforge.",
