With the Steam Squasher, you can have a Compressor in a much larger scale, similarly to the other Steam Multiblocks. If you feel like compressing recipes are taking too long, which they probably are, this is a good solution to your problems.\n\nOnce the multi forms, provide lots of steam to get lots of compressed items.",
