But to get a much better yield, you can show you are a GregTech hero and search NEI for an alternate recipe using dusts. Obzinite pickaxes are able to mine ardite in the Nether.\n\nLeave the rest of your Obzinite as liquid in your smeltery, you'll want it to make the Tool Forge. You need 16 ingots in the smeltery to make 2 Large Plates.",
