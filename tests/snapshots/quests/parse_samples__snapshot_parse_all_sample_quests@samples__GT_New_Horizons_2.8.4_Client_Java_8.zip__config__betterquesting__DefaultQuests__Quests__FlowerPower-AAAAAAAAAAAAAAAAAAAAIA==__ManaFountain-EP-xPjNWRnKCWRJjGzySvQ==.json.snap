    "desc": "The Mana Fountain allows for quick and seamless automation of Mana Pool recipes.\n\nYou can assemble the multiblock as specified in the Lexica Botania / NEI. After it's assembled, right clicking it using the Wand of the Forest will show you whether it's complete and the amount of internally stored mana.\n\nYou can send the controller mana directly by either using a spreader or a spark much like a Mana Pool. Technically you don't have to use the Mana Pool in the center of the multiblock for it to function, but it is placed conveniently so that you can (plus, it doesn't hurt to have an extra buffer).\n\nItems are allowed to input from any side of the controller, but can only output from the bottom. For early automation, it's recommended to just use hoppers. Once you uinlock AE2 however you can simply place an interface underneath the controller with the appropriate patterns and it should push and pull items automatically.\n\n[warn]You cannot craft Alchemy or Conjuration recipes using this multiblock, those are separate multiblocks that you will unlock with more advanced robot arm technology.[/warn]\n\n[note]This structure can absolutely wall-share. It has the perfect design to be able to share 4 different Mana Fountains between the center pool.[/note]\n",
