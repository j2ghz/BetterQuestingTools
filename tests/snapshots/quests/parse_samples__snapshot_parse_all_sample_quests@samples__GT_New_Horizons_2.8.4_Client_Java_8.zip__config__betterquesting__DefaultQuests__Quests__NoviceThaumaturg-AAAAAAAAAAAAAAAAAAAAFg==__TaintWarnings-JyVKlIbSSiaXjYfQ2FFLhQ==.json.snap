    "desc": "Now that you have started using Vis in the form of Essentia, a warning about Taint.\n\nVis in the state of Essentia is unstable if not stored properly. Left alone too long, or emptied out of the Crucible, Essentia will break down. But not into Vis. Rather, it will turn into Flux.\n\nFlux manifests as a liquid or a gas, but is, itself, only a nuisance. Thaumaturges exposed to the stuff can end up getting Flux Flue, a condition which makes it harder to channel Vis, but it is only temporary.\n\nLarger concentrations of Flux will solidify into Thaumic Slimes, bizarre creatures that try to merge with each other to grow larger. They can be dangerous, but are no less susceptible to crossbow bolts than most things.\n\nHowever, if too much flux is allowed to linger for too long, it will corrupt the land and solidify into tendrils. This is a manifestation of the blight called Taint. Fibrous Tendrils (as well as condensed blocks thereof) spread the Tainted Lands, feeding on the magic it twists. Nodes are especially vulnerable, becoming Tainted themselves if exposed to this twisted magic.\n\nDestroying the tendrils stops the spread, but unless §oall§r are destroyed this is only temporary. A more effective solution is to destroy the Tainted Land itself, as outside this specific biome tendrils quickly starve and die off.\n\nIf you are §oexceedingly§r careless with your Crucible you can, in fact, create Tainted Lands. So you would be wise to try wasting as little Essentia as possible, and clean up any you do waste.",
