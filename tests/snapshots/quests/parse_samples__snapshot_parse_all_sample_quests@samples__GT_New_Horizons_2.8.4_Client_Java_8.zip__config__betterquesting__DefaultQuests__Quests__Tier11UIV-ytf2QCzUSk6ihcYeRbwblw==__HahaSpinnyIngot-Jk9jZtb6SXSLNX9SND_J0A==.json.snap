You need to macerate your tesseracts to get the dust and then blast it at such high temperatures that you'll need a coolant to help manage the heat.\n\nDue to the impossible nature of the tesseract particles, you'll need a medium to enable them to form 3D shapes. Tungsten, for some reason, works very well for this purpose.\n\nThe ingot itself is also not very stable; therefore, a coating of titansteel must be applied during the cooling process.\n\n[note]Consider passively generating it. This process is slow.[/note]",
