    "desc": "To get Witchery seeds, use a hoe on grass blocks away from water. To open the rest of the questline, you will need to do Thaumcraft quests and research the Witchery tab in the Thaumonomicon.\n\nAccording to legend, when the root of the Mandrake plant is dug up it screams and kills all who hear it. This is only partially true. A fully grown Mandrake may scream causing immense discomfort to those around. This is why it is best to harvest the Mandrake root at night when the plant is more likely to be dormant. The fully grown Mandrake can be harvested to obtain more Mandrake seeds and a Mandrake.\n\nBreaking a fully grown Mandrake plant will either yield Mandrake Root or the Mandrake may awaken and cause all sorts of mischief (and pain to the ears!).\n\nBelladonna seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage belladonna plant. The fully grown belladonna plant can be harvested to obtain more Belladonna seeds and a Belladonna flower.\n\nSnowbell seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage snowbell plant. The fully grown snowbell plant can be harvested to obtain more Snowbell seeds, snowballs and occasionally an Icy Needle.\n\nWater Artichoke seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Water Artichoke plant. The fully grown Water Artichoke plant can be harvested to obtain more Water Artichoke seeds and a Water Artichoke Globe.\n\nWater Artichoke seeds can only be planted on water source blocks.\n\nGarlic is a plantable crop that can be used to make tasty food, and to deal with vampires. It may be planted on tilled farm land, and will grow in five stages. When full grown the plant may be harvested for up to three dropped garlic bulbs. Which may either be replanted, or used in a crafting recipe.\n\nGarlic bulbs can be used to make meaty stew, a particularly nourishing meal. It is also the main ingredient in making a Garlic Garland, a useful tool in warding off vampires. Finally, garlic can be used by witches in a Witches' Cauldron to make a vampire Weakening brew, and by Witch Hunters, to make vampire resistant armor.\n\nWolfsbane seeds can be planted and eventually grow into the multistage Wolfsbane plant. The fully grown Wolfsbane plant can be harvested to obtain more Wolfsbane seeds and the Wolfsbane flower.",
