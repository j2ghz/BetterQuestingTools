Then EBF and then freeze it to get the Tungstensteel ingot.\n\nSome of Tungstensteel Dust you don't need to smelt as you will want to use it for HSS-G!\n\n[note]Note that Tungsten Trioxide to Tungsten Ingot has reduced smelt time. This does not apply to the pure version. You're gonna need a bunch of it in IV as well as the TS, so keep this in mind.[/note]",
