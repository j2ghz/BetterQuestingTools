We have people that have looked at the code, we assure you. §oUnless§r it counts as a weed (venomilia Gr 8+, any other crop Gr 24+), then it loses maybe 1 stat. Maybe. And you can just increase it again too. And it might not take effect even then if you don't apply too much, like a crop matron won't.\n\nUsage:\nWhile holding Weed-Ex, right-click on a Crop to apply it. It can also be placed in a Crop Manager to automatically apply it to your crops.",
