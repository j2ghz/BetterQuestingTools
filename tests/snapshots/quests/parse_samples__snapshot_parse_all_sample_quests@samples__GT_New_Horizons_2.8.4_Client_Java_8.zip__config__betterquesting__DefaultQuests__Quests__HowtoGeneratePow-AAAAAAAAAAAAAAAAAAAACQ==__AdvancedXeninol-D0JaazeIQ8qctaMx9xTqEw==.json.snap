If you don't already have a Quantum Anomaly setup for it, you can use this. Who knows what'll come in the future?\n\nThese recipes are the same 0.144 ratio ones that you've seen before and, since they're just before the final step, they will bottleneck you on the path to compact reactor setups. The one to focus on is Advanced Nitinol, which is the second last recipe, and where you'll need 9.216, or 10 Mk3 reactors to sustain a Celestial Tungsten compact at the end. If you build a compact here, however, you can feed 6 compacts as long as everything that comes before this is fast enough.",
