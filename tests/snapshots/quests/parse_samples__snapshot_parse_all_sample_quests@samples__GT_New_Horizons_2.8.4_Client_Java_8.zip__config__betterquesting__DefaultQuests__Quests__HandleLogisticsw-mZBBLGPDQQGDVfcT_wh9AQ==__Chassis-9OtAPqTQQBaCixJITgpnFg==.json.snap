For now, a Mk 1, which can hold 1 module, will work.\n\nYou can insert modules directly in the chassis by right-clicking said chassis with the module. But if you need to take modules out of a chassis or configure a module in one, you need to right-click the chassis with a wrench to access its UI.",
