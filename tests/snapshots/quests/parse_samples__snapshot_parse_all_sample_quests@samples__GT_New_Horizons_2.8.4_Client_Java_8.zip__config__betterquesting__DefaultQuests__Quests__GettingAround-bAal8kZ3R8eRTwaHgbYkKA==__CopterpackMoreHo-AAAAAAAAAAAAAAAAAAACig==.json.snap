It uses several different types of fuels to power it.\n\nBuckets of creosote, lava, oil, diesel, cetane, ethanol, and fuel will work.\n\nEquip your jetpack and hit Shift and the adventure backpack's action-key. You can also switch between hover and normal mode.\n\nMax flying height is limited to Y-200.\n\nVertical velocity decreases linearly with height after overcoming optimal height - 135 for jetpack and 100 for copter.\n\n[note]Dropped items will be pushed away from you, just like a helicopter pushes things away, so be careful in the End, or by cliffsides.[/note]",
