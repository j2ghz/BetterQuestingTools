If an item isn't appropriate for the farm's configuration, the hatch will simply reject it.\n\nExtracting items\nAny item that is harvested by the Multifarm is automatically ejected by the farm hatches into inventories or pipes. Pipes can be used to extract from other sides. You may need more than one, or a better conveyor if it isn't extracting fast enough for you.",
