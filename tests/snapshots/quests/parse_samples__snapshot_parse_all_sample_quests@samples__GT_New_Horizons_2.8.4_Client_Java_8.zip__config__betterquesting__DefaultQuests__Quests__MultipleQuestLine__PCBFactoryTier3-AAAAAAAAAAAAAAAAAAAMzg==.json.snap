Well the silver nanite isn't rigid enough for that so a new nanite will be needed... and so will new casings. Heard that celestial tungsten is a good candidate for a frame. Quantum can be used for the protection as these nanites will be forever flying around inside.\n\nThe structure will need to change as it needs to be a bit bigger and taller.\n\n[note]Works the same as the Tier 2 in most cases, but allows the player to use even less resources by using a gold nanite.[/note]",
