Let's craft some wooden Pressure plates and Buttons to open these Doors.\n\nDoors will open when they receive a redstone signal, and close again after it stops. If you place the plates on either side of a door, it will open when you step on it. Or a monster does. Double doors will open together.\n\nYou'll need to use Oak for this quest. Purchase some saplings from the Coins tab if you don't have any nearby.\n\nPressure plates will send a redstone signal when an entity is on top of them. There are different types, like items or not, or mobs/player/any entity/etc.\n\nButtons will emit one for about 2 seconds before resetting.\n\nLevers will emit a signal until switched back off.",
