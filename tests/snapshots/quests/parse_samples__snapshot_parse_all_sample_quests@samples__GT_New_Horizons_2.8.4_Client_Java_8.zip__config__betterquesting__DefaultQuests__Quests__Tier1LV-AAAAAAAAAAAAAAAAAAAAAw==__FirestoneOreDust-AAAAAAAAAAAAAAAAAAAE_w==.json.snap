Unfortunately, it's in the nether...at the bottom of the lava ocean!\n\nHere are some tips for finding it:\n\n-Firestone only spawns in deep lava, at least 6 deep. It will only replace netherrack, so a fjord filled with soulsand won't have any. Can you think of ways to check the lava depth, and what's down there?\n-Alternatively, if you keep your head at just the correct height above the lava and at the correct angle, you'll be able to see underneath it - surely there must be a hovering jetpack?\n-...or just look for the biome when your cursor is over the JM map. Hell is the default one that has netherrack.\n\nFirestone can be mined with the GT miners, if you place it within horizontal range. Firestone ore and products will cause random fires to start nearby, so get it into a backpack quickly!",
