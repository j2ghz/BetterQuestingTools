Simply place it in the belt bauble slot and it should be fully functional! The HV one should serve you nicely for now.\n\n[note]You can upgrade the Charge Pack as you unlock items that require higher voltages for charging. The Charge Pack will charge anything of-tier or lower- but not higher.[/note]",
