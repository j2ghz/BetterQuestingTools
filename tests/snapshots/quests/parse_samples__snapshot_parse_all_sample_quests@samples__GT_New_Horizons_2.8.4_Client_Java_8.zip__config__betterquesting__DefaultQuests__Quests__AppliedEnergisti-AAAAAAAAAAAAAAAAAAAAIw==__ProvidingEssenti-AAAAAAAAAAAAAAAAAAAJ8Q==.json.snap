Since it's effectively a magic ME Interface, you can also use it instead of an Essentia Import Bus next to your Alembics or the Advanced Alchemical Furnace.\n\nThe Infusion Provider is for devices that draw essentia through the air, like the Runic Matrix (infusion) or Overchanting Table. It doesn't need to be next to the device.\n\nThey both obviously need the essentia they request to be accessible by the network to work.",
