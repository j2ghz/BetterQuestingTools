Some serious refining steps are in order!\n\n§6You'll need it for a ton of stuff like UIV and UMV superconductors, UEV+ hatches, or parts of the Dyson Swarm.§r\n\nCompared to the previous plastics, most of the steps required here are not chemical reactions. They are also very slow, so you might want to use a mega multiblock to help with that. This production line also underlines the necessity of large-scale plasma production. You will only need more going forward.\n\n[note]Super Heavy Radox will be needed for Dimensionally Shifted Superfluid, so store some for later.[/note]\n\n[note]The Heavy Radox you get as a byproduct can be used for MkV Naquadah Fuel.[/note]",
