If you're the type that accidentally does things, only use this when necessary, as it's easy to mess up and use it to harvest/destroy your crops when you wanted to get rid of a weed.\n\nYou can use it to get seeds from crops when they're §9immature§r using §6right-click§r at very low rates. Using [warn]left-click[/warn] when §9immature§r will result in nothing.\n\nIf it's §amature§r, use §6left-click§r to have a higher chance of a seed dropping. Using [warn]right-click[/warn] when §amature§r will result in lower seed drops than punching it normally.\n\nKeep in mind that the higher the tier/stats of the crop, the lower the chances. By a lot.\n\n[note]The formula is 1+tanh((-1)(X+5((-Re/2)+Gr+Ga)/21)/12); X=0 to 16, where Re, Gr, Ga are respectively Resistance, Growth and Gain stat of the crop, and X is tier. Don't ask me whether this is for L/R-click, ask bart or look at the code.[/note]",
