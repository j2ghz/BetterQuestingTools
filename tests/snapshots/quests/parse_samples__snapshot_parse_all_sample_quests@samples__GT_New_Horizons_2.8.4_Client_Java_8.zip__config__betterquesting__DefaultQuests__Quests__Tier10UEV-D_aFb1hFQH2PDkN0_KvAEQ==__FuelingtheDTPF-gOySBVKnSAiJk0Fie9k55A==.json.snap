Making these catalysts requires a lot of power and time, so you will almost certainly want to passive this with many machines.\n\nIn UIV, you will unlock the §p§oplasma mixer§r, a dedicated multiblock that can make catalyst much faster than you currently can, although this comes at an enormous power cost. Either way, it's probably a good idea to get this as soon as you can.",
