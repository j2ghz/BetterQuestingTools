Thorium and Phosphate are retained in the form of a solid slag powder.\n\nThen transfer the muddy solution to a Dissolution Tank and continue to soak it in nitric acid. The undissolved powder is then meticulously filtered out, yielding some Cerium.\n\nThen dilute the result with water to adjust the pH.",
