These multiblocks have two major benefits:\n-They innately have 256 parallels.\n-They can use TecTech exotic hatches, allowing you to empty out tremendous amounts of power into them.\n\n[note]To get real benefit from these multis, you will want to use lots of power and take advantage of their extreme parallelization - consider whether or not you can actually make use of these before you go off building a Mega Blast Furnace in HV...[/note]",
