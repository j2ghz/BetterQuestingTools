Don't be so quick to throw away your steam machines, you'll probably want to keep using them for a while.\n\nTo make your life easier, you'll want to focus on getting a wiremill and bender first... once you suffer through making all the machine components.\n\nAfter that, the polarizer, assembler, lathe, and chemical reactor+fluid solidifier (for rubber) all help make things cheaper.\n\nLV machines are more energy-efficient than their steam counterparts because steam machines convert Steam to Power with 50% efficiency, when the starting LV Steam Turbine has 85% efficiency.\n\nULV doesn't exist.",
