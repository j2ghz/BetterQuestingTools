Look no further than the §5§lMagLev Harness§r!\n\nWith the MagLev, you can have creative flight whenever you are within range of a MagLev Pylon and have the Harness equip.\n\nThis will work even when unpowered, however the range of the Pylon gets doubled when it's given §21A§r of it's corresponding tier of power. The MagLev will only draw power while you are in-range, not passively. A Harness can only be tethered to one Pylon at a time, but a Pylon can attach to any number of Harnesses. Will only consume 1A §nregardless§r of how many Harnesses are tethered to the Pylon§r.\n\n[note]Check the tooltip to see the range of your chosen Pylon, the MV one has a maximum range of 16 (33 x 33 x 33) when powered![/note]",
