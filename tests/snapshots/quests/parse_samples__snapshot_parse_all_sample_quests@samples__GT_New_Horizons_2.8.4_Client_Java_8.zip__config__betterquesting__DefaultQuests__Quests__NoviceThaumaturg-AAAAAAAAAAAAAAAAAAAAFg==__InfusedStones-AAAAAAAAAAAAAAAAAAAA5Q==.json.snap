You wonder what happens to regular stone if it's exposed to large amounts of magic for such a long time. Maybe it's time to go mining?\n\nThere are 3 veins. There's amber and cinnabar in each. They aren't super useful, but make sure to keep hold of some at least.\n\nEven when you find these infused stones, they won't drop the infused shards you desperately need. Rather, you have to process the raw ores themselves. The easiest way to do that is to throw these raw ores in your Forge Hammer.\n\nLater when you have a Sifter, you can sift purified ores for more shards. An autoclave can also turn shard dust into a shard. Maybe there's a magical way to do the same thing?",
