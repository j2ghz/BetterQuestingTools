Assign the storage of a connected inventory with at most 9 different kinds of items by setting 9 items as filter on the module.\n\n2. Assign a connected inventory as a default route. The default route is a destination for items that have no other valid storage spaces.\n\n§cNote: remember to always check if the default route has additional spaces because items that are stuck in the pipes without a destination will eventually YEET themselves out of the pipes.",
