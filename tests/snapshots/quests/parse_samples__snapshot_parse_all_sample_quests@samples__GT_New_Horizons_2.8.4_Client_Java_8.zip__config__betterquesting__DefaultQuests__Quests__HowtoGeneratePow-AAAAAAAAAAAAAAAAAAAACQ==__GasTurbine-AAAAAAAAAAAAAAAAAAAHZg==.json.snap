    "desc": "A Large Gas Turbine is more fuel-efficient than singleblock turbines, and can have lower pollution output with upgraded mufflers.\n\nYou will also need a Muffler and Dynamo Hatch to complete the multiblock. Don't forget to use a Fluid Regulator, to control the flow rate into the multi! It can usually be an LV Fluid Regulator, since the optimal flow is much lower here than in Steam Turbines.\n\nEach turbine material has a specific fuel efficiency (the higher, the more EU you get from the same amount of fuel), and the multi only reaches this efficiency if the fuel flow into it matches the optimal flow.\n\nIf you go beyond the optimal flow, you will get a higher EU/t value, but less fuel efficiency, and the maximum EU/t value depends on the turbine type and its Overflow Efficiency tier. For this type of turbine, tier 1 reaches the max at 150% of optimal flow to produce 112% of the EU/t, tier 2 reaches the max at 300% of optimal flow to produce 180% of the EU/t and tier 3 reaches the max at 450% of optimal flow to produce 252% of the EU/t. The closer you get to this maximum, the more fuel efficiency you're throwing away.\n\nFor the best turbine materials, see the spreadsheet and Large Turbine Calculator.",
