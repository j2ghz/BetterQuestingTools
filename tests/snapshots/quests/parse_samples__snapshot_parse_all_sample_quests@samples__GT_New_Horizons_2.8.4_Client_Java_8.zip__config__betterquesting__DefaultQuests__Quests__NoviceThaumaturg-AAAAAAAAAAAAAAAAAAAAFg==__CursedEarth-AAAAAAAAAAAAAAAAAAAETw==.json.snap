You can use these blocks to make a mob spawner, or place one under a vanilla spawner to let it run even when you're not around.\n\nWhen setting up a mob spawner in the Nether using Cursed Earth, poor design can cause huge TPS issues.\n\nMake sure the Cursed Earth is not attached to anything from the Nether. For example, you can place it on top of marble, but the marble cannot touch anything in the nether (netherrack, brick, etc.), and must be floating in the air. Also, limit the Cursed Earth to 1 chunk max, with 2 block buffer to the chunk edge, including a wall.",
