It would normally be a lot slower, but the next step needs only a small amount of Calcium.\n\nKeep in mind that, at the end of each of the three fusion chains, the plasma amount gets multiplied, which means that most of your bottlenecks will be near the end of the entire setup, if you're going for Celestial Tungsten Plasma.\n\nYou will need 2.13 reactors with this recipe to feed 1 reactor with the next step.",
