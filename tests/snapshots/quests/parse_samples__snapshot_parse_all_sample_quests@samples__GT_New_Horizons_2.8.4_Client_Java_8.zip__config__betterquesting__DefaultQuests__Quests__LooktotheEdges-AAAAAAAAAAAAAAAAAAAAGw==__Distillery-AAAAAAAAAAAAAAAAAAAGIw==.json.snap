The distillery must be within about 14 - 16 blocks of an altar to draw power from it - a small icon is shown in the interface if no power is available.\n\nOne or two ingredients are distilled together and will result in up to four resulting materials. A supply of clay jars is also needed to capture some or all of the distillates.",
