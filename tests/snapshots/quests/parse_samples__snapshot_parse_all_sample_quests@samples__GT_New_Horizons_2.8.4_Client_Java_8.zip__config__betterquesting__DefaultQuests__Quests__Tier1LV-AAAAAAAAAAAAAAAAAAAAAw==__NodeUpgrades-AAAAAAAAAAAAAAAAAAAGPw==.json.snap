With it, you can set up simple autocrafting.\n\nPut a WIU in a transfer node attached to a crafting table. On the other side of the table, the 3x3 area is now treated as a crafting grid. Place items in inventories on the other side and if they make a valid recipe, the WIU will craft it. To speed it up, you will need to wait until HV for stainless steel.\n\nAlso, if you place a node on a block of cobble that has lava and water next to it, and a WIU in it, it will produce cobble for you automatically. Use upgrades to get more at a time and faster.\n\n[warn]The WIU can NOT be used for infinite water in GTNH.[/warn]",
