Some items will give you an enormous or unlimited time debuff timer, which effectively kills you because there's no way to get rid of it.\n\nOther items will give you a general sickness with many debuffs, but not Radiation. That can be removed the normal ways, Milk, Terrawart, Aqua bees, etc.\n\nIf you wear a Hazmat suit (and rubber boots!) you are not affected by radioactive effects at all. Same for some other armors that list hazmat protection.",
