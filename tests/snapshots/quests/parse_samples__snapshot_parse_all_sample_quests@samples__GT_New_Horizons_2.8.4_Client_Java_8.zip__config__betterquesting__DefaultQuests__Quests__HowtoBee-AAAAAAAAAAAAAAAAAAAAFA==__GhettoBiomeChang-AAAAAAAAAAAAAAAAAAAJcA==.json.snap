You can try planting a Silverwood Sapling to get one with a pure node, or use other methods to move one.\n\nKeep in mind a 'bare' pure node won't change anything unless it has Victus. You can try to use Sinister or Tainted, but...no refunds. These nodes have a radius of 11. To change the biome back, use an Ethereal Bloom (radius of 7). Keep in mind that both Pech and Wisps spawn in 'Magical' type biomes.",
