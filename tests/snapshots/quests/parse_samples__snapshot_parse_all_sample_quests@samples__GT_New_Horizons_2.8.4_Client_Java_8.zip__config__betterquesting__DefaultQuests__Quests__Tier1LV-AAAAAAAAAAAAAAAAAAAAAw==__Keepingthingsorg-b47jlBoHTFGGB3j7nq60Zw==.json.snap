Today must be your lucky day, because these item holders let you do exactly that!\n\nThey allow your machines to hold a small number of extra items, though each slot can only store one item at a time. There are three versions of this cover, each offering a different amount of storage:\n\nBasic Item Holder: 9 slots\nGood Item Holder: 12 slots\nAdvanced Item Holder: 15 slots\n\n[note]If that's still not enough space and you are already using the highest tier, you can simply attach multiple holders to your machine of choice.[/note]",
