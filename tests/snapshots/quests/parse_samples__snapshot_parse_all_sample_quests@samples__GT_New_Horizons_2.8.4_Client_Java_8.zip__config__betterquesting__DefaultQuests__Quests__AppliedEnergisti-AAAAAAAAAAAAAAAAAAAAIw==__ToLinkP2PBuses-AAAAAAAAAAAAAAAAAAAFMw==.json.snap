Shift-right-click on a non-configurable object (or the air) to clear. They are also used to link the input P2P tunnel to the corresponding output P2P tunnels. They can also link Vis Relays to compatible devices.\n\nIf you're doing more advanced operations in a large network of P2Ps, it's recommended you use the advanced memory card. It has a helpful UI that allows you to visualize and set names, inputs, and outputs of P2P tunnels. \n\n[note]Remember P2Ps can only have 1 input! The only exception being fluid P2Ps whose input can function as an output and whose outputs can function as an input.[/note]",
