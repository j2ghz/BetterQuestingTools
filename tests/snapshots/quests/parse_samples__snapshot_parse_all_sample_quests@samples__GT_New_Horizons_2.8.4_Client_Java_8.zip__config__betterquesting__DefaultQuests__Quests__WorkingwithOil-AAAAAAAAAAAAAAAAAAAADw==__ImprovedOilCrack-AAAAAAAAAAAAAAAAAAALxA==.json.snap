If you are still using low-tier coils, this is a great time to upgrade them to Nichrome and enjoy a 40% discount. You could also do TPV directly.\n\nBy the way, you can wall-share Oil Crackers, just like DTs, LCRs and many other multis, and doing this will save on the amount of coils you need!\n\n[note]You only need to do one of the two tasks.[/note]",
