It will follow you like an eager puppy, to the ends of the earth - but you probably should pick her up before changing dimensions. A lightning strike can provide more room. Shift-right-clicking will turn it back into an item without losing its contents. Look for her in the GTNH tab of the Thaumonomicon.",
