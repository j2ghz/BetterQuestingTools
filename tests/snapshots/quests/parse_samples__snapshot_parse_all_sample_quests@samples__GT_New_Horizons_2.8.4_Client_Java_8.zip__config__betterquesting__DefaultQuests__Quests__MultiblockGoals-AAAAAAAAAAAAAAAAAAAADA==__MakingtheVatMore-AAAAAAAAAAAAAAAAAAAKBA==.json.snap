    "desc": "Looking at the Vat's recipes you are likely discouraged by the small amount of fluid being produced per recipe. Don't worry! Fluid consumption and production shown in NEI are just the baseline for the lowest efficiency. The efficiency of Vat depends on the amount of fluid in the Output Hatch.\n\nThe efficiency gradually increases as the output hatch fills up and reaches maximum efficiency when it is §cexactly half-filled§r. If the hatch fills even more, the efficiency goes down again, so try to keep it close to half! At maximum efficiency the amount of fluid consumed and produced per recipe is multiplied by 1001. The items and culture are not affected.\n\nThere are different means to keep it at half, including OC (not SFM, it doesn't like BW fluids), fluid detector+machine controller, or a fluid regulator, as well as more off the wall ones such as frames or block-sharing. If you choose the fluid detector route, remember that using a larger output hatch will make it easier to keep it close to half-filled.",
