It can only be brewed in the Spirit World!\n\nThe Brew can be thrown at the ground and the liquid will burst out (the source block can later be picked up in a bucket). Standing in the liquid will have a minor healing effect for most creatures. Demonic or undead creatures will be weakened. Nightmares standing in the liquid will lose their invulnerability effect!\n\nHaving a pool of flowing spirit near a Dream Weaver of Nightmares will decrease the chance of a nightmare by 10 percent for each source block (up to 3).",
