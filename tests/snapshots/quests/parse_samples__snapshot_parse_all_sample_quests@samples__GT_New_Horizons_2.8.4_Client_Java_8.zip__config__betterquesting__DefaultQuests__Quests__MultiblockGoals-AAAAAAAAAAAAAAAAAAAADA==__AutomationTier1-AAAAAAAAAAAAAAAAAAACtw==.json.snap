Make sure to connect the pipe to the faucet using a wrench. Now the molten fluid will flow inside the pipe. Under or next to the pipe you have to place the casting basins or tables.\n\nA hopper and a chest underneath will auto-output products from the casting blocks.\n\nNOTE: Faucets will output precisely 144L each activation if you toggle it off immediately. That's going to have some uses later on...",
