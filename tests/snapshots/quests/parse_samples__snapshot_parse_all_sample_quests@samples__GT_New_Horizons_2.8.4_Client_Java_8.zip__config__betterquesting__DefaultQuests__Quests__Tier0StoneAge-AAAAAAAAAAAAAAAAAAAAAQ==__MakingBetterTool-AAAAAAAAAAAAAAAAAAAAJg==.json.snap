See the Multiblock Goals tab for details. You can also grab some extra blocks from some villages, but they don't count towards the quest.\n\nAlternatively, there are also one-time-use clay casts available.\n\nYou can then use your fancy bronze to make better tools with a higher mining level.\n\nRemember, you need to use the pickaxe a bit to gather mining XP if you want the full mining level on your bronze pickaxe. Certain tool upgrades can give that directly if you have an upgrade slot available.",
