This upgrade to the staff of traveling can move you even further, even faster, and will never run out of energy.\n\nRight-click:\n * If targeting a travel anchor: teleport to it, 2048 range\n * If looking at a block: teleport to it, 512 range\n * If no block in range: teleport forward, 64 range\n * If looking at a block within 4 range: teleport to the other side of a wall, 16 range\n * No cooldown\n\nShift-right-click:\n * Same as right-click, but ignoring travel anchors\n * Travel anchors will be hidden from view while holding shift\n\n[note]Tip: You won't be able to see travel anchors that are far away, but can still teleport to them if they are in range and chunk-loaded. Try using JourneyMap waypoints to mark anchors![/note]\n\n[note]Note: The right-click and shift-right-click actions are fully configurable. Check the EnderIO Staff Settings configs!\nConfig action values:\n 0: Do nothing\n 1: Teleport to look / forward\n 2: Teleport to anchor\n 3: Teleport to anchor, or to look / forward if no anchor[/note]",
