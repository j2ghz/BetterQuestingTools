This Multiblock is able to produce large amounts of Water if fed with Steam (1500L/s).\n\nLike other Steam Multiblocks, it can be upgraded by using Steel Frame Boxes instead of Bronze ones, which doubles the Water output at no additional Steam cost.\n\n§4It is, however, still dependent on how humid the Biome you are in is, so keep that in mind.§r\n\n§9Hint: You can find small lead ore in the Nether!§r\n\n[note]P.S. The optional quest item count includes the cost for the controller. [/note]",
