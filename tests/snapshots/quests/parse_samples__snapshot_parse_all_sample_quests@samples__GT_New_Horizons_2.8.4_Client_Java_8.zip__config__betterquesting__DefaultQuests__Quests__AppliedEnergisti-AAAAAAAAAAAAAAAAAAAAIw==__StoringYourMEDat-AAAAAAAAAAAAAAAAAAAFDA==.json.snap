ME drives show their contents and the storage cell status on the front of the drive face.\n\nRed - Indicates the storage cell is full.\nOrange - Indicates the storage cell cannot hold any more types, but it can store more items.\nGreen - Indicates the cell can hold more types, or more items.\nBlack - Indicates there is no channel, or power is offline.\n\nIt's important to note, that without an ME Network this block does nothing. It's only useful when combined with a way to input, and output items, and requires 2 AE/t power to function, and additional power for each storage cell stored inside it.\n\nAbout Priority: Many devices in AE2 have a priority setting, this determines what gets items first. This is useful in some situations, but not so much in others. Higher number = higher priority.",
