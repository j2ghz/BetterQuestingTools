Unlike the other Boilers, this only outputs Steam on the output port side.\n\nYou need Silver from small ores to craft Solar Boilers. Later in LV you can get much more in the Twilight Forest.\n\n§3Hint: The Simple Solar Boiler calcifies and becomes less efficient over time, dropping down to a minimum of 40L/s. Later on you can consider using Distilled Water to avoid calcification.",
