I believe you won't want to set up another line after finishing Platinum, PBI and Lanthanide lines.\n\nLucky, you can directly smelt the NOM dust into naquadah nuggets in EBF, but it is inefficient and you will lose the byproducts in it.\n\n[note]PS: The Naquadah Oxide Mixture was once called \"Naquadah Metal Oxide Mixture\" and someone called it Nq-MOM for short.[/note]",
