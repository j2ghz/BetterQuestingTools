Time to refine it.\n\nYou'll need to use a circuit to pick which of the products you want. Later on you can make a Distillation Tower to get all of them, but that's far away for now.\n\nYou can also distill many other fluids! There are two that are useful, but take a long time to distill, so you should set them up in advance:\nLubricant (from Creosote) and Distilled Water (from Water).",
