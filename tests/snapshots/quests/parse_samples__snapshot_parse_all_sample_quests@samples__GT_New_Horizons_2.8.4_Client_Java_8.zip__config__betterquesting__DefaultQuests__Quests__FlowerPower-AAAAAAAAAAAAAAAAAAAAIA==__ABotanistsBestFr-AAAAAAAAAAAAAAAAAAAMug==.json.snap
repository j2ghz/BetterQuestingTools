    "desc": "Functional flowers are a large part of Botania. Most of them have nuances to how they operate, and these are generally best explained in the Lexica Botania: a codex of all Botania knowledge. This questline will explain the basics, but be sure to keep a copy of the Lexica Botania on hand so you can easily reference the details.\n\nBesides being a repository of useful information, the Lexica Botania has another function: if, while holding it, you look at any Botania block in the world, you can shift-right-click on that block to open up the relevant page.\n\nSomething else you'll want for functional flowers is a handful of redstone roots. Flowers which have a redstone root in their recipe have the ability to toggle whether they are active by applying a redstone signal. Make a few before you move on.",
