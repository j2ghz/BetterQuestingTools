You need something to get the fluid into the correct buffer other than inserting the fluid into the buffer manually.\n\nThere are 2 pipes that can do the job: transfer fluid into a tank connected to a fluid basic pipe allocated to said fluid.\n\n1. Logistics Fluid Extractor Pipe. It extracts fluid from connected buffer to the correct big storage tank. It doesn't require a pump but it is slower.\n\n2. Logistics Fluid Insertion Pipe. It does not pull fluids from tanks actively, requiring a GT pump if you are using GT tanks, but it can send fluids faster.\n\nTake a pick :)",
