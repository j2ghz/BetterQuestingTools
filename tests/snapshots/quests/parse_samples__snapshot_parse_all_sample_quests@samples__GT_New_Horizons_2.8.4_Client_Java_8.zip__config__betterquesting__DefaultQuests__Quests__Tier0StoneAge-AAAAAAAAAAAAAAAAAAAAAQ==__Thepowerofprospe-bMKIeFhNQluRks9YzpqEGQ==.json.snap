However veins generate extra small ores related to the vein in their chunks, so they can still be useful in your search (though not all small ores are related to a nearby vein so don't be fooled).[/note]\n\n[note]Another great interaction is that you can use the NEI search bar in highlight mode (double-click it) and then go to the map screen to get the matching uncovered ore veins highlighted![/note]",
