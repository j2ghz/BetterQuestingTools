    "desc": "Now that you are MV, you can make an Adventure Backpack. This very useful backpack can do many things. It can store 2 tools for quick access, has internal tanks for containing liquids - use the Hose to access them, a built in crafting table, and storage.\n\nWhen placed on your back, it can be accessed using a quick-access key, default is B. Check your controls for details.\n\nWhen placed on the ground, it can be accessed with a right-click. While on the ground, the bedroll can be deployed and used.\n\nThey can also be upgraded to add special abilities. For a full list, visit [url]https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Adventure_Backpacks[/url].\n\n[note]It uses up the same slot as the Coal Jetpack and the Copterpack, so you'll either need to choose one, or swap them around.[/note]",
