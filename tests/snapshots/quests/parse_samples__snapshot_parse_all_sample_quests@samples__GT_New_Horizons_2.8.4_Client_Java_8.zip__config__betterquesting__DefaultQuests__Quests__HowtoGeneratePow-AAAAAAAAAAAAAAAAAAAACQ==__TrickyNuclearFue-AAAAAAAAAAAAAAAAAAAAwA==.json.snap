Try to come up with a heat-neutral design as close to the limit as possible to take advantage of this. It lasts 1/2 the time, and produces more heat once the reactor is over 50%. A fuel for all the engineers out there.\n\n[note]You'll need to run a uranium reactor for a while to get some plutonium if you don't have another way to get it. Remember that there's more than 1 type![/note]\n\n[warn]Make sure to test in creative and/or use protection against explosions![/warn]",
