Use an extraction module to extract items into the system. It is slow, but everything that has a valid destination will be sent into the network.\n\n2. Use a QuickSort module. It extracts a whole stack of items that has a valid destination. This module will ignore items that have no destinations other than the default route though...\n\nIt is your choice.
