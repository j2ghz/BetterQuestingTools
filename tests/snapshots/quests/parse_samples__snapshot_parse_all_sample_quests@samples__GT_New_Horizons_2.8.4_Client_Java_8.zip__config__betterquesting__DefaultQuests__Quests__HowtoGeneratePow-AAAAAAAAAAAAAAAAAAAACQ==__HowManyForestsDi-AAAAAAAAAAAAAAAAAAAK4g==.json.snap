You can offset that by just generating more Benzene, alongside Phenol and Toluene in a Distillation Tower, or use Naphtha instead... You have many options at this point, surely enough to fight the increasing power demands of your automation.\n\nBenzene doesn't get upgraded in HV, only in EV. You'll be able to make Nitrobenzene when you're there, and burn it in some turbines bigger than this one.",
