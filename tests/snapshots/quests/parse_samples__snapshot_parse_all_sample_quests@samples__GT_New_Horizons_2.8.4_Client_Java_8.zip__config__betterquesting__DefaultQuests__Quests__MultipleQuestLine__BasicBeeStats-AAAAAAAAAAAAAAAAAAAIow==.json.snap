    "desc": "There are a couple of basic bees that have good stats you want to breed into your breeding stock.\n\nCave Dwelling - Rocky - This lets you put the bee housing underneath or inside. Handy for putting a chest on top for products.\n\nNocturnal - Rocky - This keeps your bees working all night long, and in the dark.\n\nRain Tolerant - Water - Keep producing even when it is raining.\n\nHigh Fertility - Wintry - For breeding purposes, you want the maximum number of drones produced.\n\nKeep in mind that specialty products from bees require the Jubilant state.\nTo be in this state, a bee needs to have its naturally preferred humidity and temperature. Just being able to work due to tolerance traits is not enough.\n\nFor example, a Salt bee needs Warm/Normal climate. Even if it has +- humidity and temp, it will not produce its Salt comb unless it is in a Warm/Normal climate. Use Alveary upgrades to make sure it is in its preferred temp/humidity.",
