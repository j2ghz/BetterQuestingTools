Using the pH neutral water you get from this machine, you can process wafers twice as fast.\n\nThis is the first real complex automation challenge in the waterline, it's up to you to figure out how you want to deal with the pH neutralization process. Have fun!\n\n[note]This multiblock is very picky about where its hatches for acids and bases go. If you can't figure out why it's not forming, chances are you forgot to place these hatches in the correct location. Use the hologram projector to see where they go.[/note]",
