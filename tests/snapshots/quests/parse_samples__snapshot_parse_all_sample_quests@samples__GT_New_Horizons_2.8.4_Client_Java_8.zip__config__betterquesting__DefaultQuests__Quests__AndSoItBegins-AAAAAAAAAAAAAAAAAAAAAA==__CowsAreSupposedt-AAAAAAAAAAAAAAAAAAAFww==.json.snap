What madness!\n\nTo stop it, use a proper GregTech Knife or Butchery Knife to kill them. Craft a flint GregTech knife with a stick and a piece of flint.\n\nTo see its recipe, see how a generic knife is made - NEI should show you many pages. The recipe you need should be on the last page. You can scroll pages with your mouse wheel.\n\n[note]Alternatively you can use the search bar to search for a specific tool material, in this case flint![/note]\n\nAs a reward, here's an iron knife to use once the flint one wears out.",
