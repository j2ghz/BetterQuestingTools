Water can be pumped in directly or use IC2 Universal water cells, normal cells aren't returned when they're used.\n\nThe Crop Manager is NOT rainproof, but you can cover it with a water source block just fine!\n\nTilled dirt still requires a nearby water block to be hydrated as the Manager will only water the crop, not the soil. Try putting a lily pad on top so it isn't annoying to walk on, or using Garden Soil instead.",
